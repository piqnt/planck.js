// This test shows how a rope joint can be used to stabilize a chain of
// bodies with a heavy payload. Notice that the rope joint just prevents
// excessive stretching and has no other effect.
// By disabling the rope joint you can see that the Box2D solver has trouble
// supporting heavy bodies with light bodies. Try playing around with the
// densities, time step, and iterations to see how they affect stability.
// This test also shows how to use contact filtering. Filtering is configured
// so that the payload does not collide with the chain.
