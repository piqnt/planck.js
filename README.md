## Try it

To try Planck.js, simply add `planck-with-testbed.js` script to your HTML code and call `planck.testbed(callback)` with your code in callback. For example:

```html
<html><body>
  <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/planck-js@0.2/dist/planck-with-testbed.js"></script>
  <script>
    planck.testbed(function(testbed) {
      var world = planck.World();
      // rest of your code
      return world; // make sure you return the world
    });
  </script>
</body></html>
```

Check out [Car example on JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/nujuxik/edit?html,output) to try it in practice.
Also see [`example`](./example/) directory for more testbed usage examples.

## API and Architecture

Planck.js includes Box2D algorithms without modification and its architecture is very similar to Box2D.
However some internal [changes](./CHANGES.md) and refactoring are made during rewrite to address differences between C++ and JavaScript.

Planck.js public API closely follows Box2D API (see [Resources](##resources-and-references)), with the following differences:

- `b2` prefix is dropped from class names, for example `b2World` is now available as `planck.World`.
- Method names are converted from UpperCamelCase to lowerCamelCase.
- Definition classes/objects (BodyDef, FixtureDef, etc.) are replaced by inline JavaScript objects (`{}`).
- Shapes are considered immutable and are not cloned when used to create fixtures.
- Listener classes are replaced with simple functions.
- `World#on(eventName, listenerFn)` and `World#off(eventName, listenerFn)` are added to add and remove event listeners. Currently supported events are:
    - `'begin-contact'`
    - `'end-contact'`
    - `'pre-solve'`
    - `'post-solve'`
    - `'remove-joint'`
    - `'remove-fixture'`
    - `'remove-body'`

### Rendering

Planck.js does not include rendering and graphics by default, however you can use one of these options:

- For testing and development use testbed, see [Try it](#try-it) and [Development](#development) sections
- Develop a renderer or integrate with an existing graphics library, see [Rendering and Integration](#rendering-and-integration) section
- Use an existing renderer, such as [RealPeha/planck-renderer](https://github.com/RealPeha/planck-renderer)

## Tutorial

_This tutorial is under development, please feel free to edit, comment or ask for new sections._

Before writing code there are a number of key concepts to learn:

- **Shape** - A shape contains geometrical information and is used in collision detections.
- **Fixture** - A fixture consists of a shape and physical properties such as density.
- **Body** - Each body is composed of a number of fixtures which are fixed together, that is a body is a set of shapes with physical properties. Bodies have position, angle, linear velocity, angular velocity, etc. which can be changed by applying linear and angular forces or impulses. Bodies represent rigid objects in the world, such as ground, a box or a car.
- **Joint** - Joints are constraints on bodies position or velocity.
- **Contact** - When two bodies touch each other (are colliding) a contact between them is created.
- **World** - A world is composed of a number of bodies and joints interacting with each other. Every time world’s step() function is called, world solver will detect any contact between bodies and then change bodies position and velocity according to velocity, forces, contacts, and joints constraints.

A physics simulation in Planck starts by creating a World and adding Bodies and Joints. So let’s create our world:

```js
var world = planck.World();
```

This will create a world with default options. You can pass a definition object as first argument to World constructor, for example:

```js
var world = planck.World({
  gravity: planck.Vec2(0, -10)
});
```
Bodies are directly created and added to world:

```js
var ground = world.createBody();
```

This will create a body with default options, which means a ‘static’ body at position 0, 0 with no velocity. You can pass a body definition object to change it:

```js
var ground = world.createBody({
  type: 'static',
  position: planck.Vec2(2, 5),
});
```

After creating a body, you can create a fixture using a shape:

```js
ground.createFixture({
  shape: planck.Edge(Vec2(-40.0, 0.0),Vec2(40.0, 0.0))
});
```


## Rendering and Integration

Planck.js does not use any renderer by default. To use or integrate it with a rendering library all you need to do 
is call `world.step(timeStep)` in each frame, and then iterate over world entities to draw or update them.
You may also want to listen to world events to remove objects which are removed from the world. For example:

```html
<script src="./path/to/planck.min.js"></script>
<script>
  var world = planck.World();

  // rendering loop
  (function loop() {
    // in each frame call world.step(timeStep) with fixed timeStep
    world.step(1 / 60);
    // iterate over bodies and fixtures
    for (var body = world.getBodyList(); body; body = body.getNext()) {
      for (var fixture = body.getFixtureList(); fixture; fixture = fixture.getNext()) {
        // draw or update fixture
      }
    }
    // request a new frame
    window.requestAnimationFrame(loop);
  })();

  world.on('remove-fixture', function(fixture) {
    // remove fixture from ui
  });
</script>
```


## Development

For development, you can run testbed locally with a live build and try examples in [`example`](./example/) directory.

1. Install `git` and `npm`

1. Clone or download this repository

1. Install npm dependencies:

        npm install

1. Run testbed and open it in your web browser (see command-line output for URL to open):

        npm run testbed
