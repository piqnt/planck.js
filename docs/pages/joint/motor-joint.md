## Motor Joint
A motor joint lets you control the motion of a body by specifying target
position and rotation offsets. You can set the maximum motor force and
torque that will be applied to reach the target position and rotation.
If the body is blocked, it will stop and the contact forces will be
proportional the maximum motor force and torque. See MotorJoint and
MotorJoint.h for details.
