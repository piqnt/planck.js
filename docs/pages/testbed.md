### Testbed
Testbed is a debugging tool that is provided with the library. It is useful to get started with Planck.js, and develop and debug physics code, and run examples.

You can run testbed online at [piqnt.com](https://piqnt.com/planck.js/), run it locally, or install it from NPM or a CDN.

Testbed is not required to use Planck.js physics. You can run and render physics world directly, with any rendering library or framework (see Rendering section for more details).
